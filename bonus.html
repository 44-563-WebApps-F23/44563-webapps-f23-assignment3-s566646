        <p> As a costume designer is responsible for designing, creating, or purchasing the costumes, and wardrobe that actors wear in a film, television, or stage production. Costume designers work similarly to a fashion designer, but design clothing specifically for film and stage productions. Therefore, costume designers must have a solid understanding of story, character, mood, and other filmmaking elements.</p>
